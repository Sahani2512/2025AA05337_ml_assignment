This project builds and compares six machine learning classifiers—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost—to predict target classes from input features. Models are evaluated using standard metrics, and a Streamlit app enables interactive data upload, model selection, and result visualization.
